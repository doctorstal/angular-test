# AngularTest

This repo contains my experiments with Angular framework.
Each is stored in one of the [branches](../branches).

## Hybrid app template

Check out [templates/hybrid-app-with-router](../tree/templates/hybrid-app-with-router) branch to use AngularJS/Angular hybrid app template. Yep, it's cool to migrate using official [guide](https://angular.io/guide/upgrade), but every step will be painful: enabling Router support, upgrading services, using third-party libs and so on.
Instead you can just use this template as a sceleton for your hybrid app and save some time.
